# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The current focus is on initializing the memory bank for the HabitJunkie project. This involves creating comprehensive documentation to understand the project structure, functionality, and technical details.

## Recent Changes
- Created the initial memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Documented the project brief, product context, system patterns, and technical context
- Analyzed the existing codebase to understand the application architecture and functionality

## Active Development Areas
1. **Core Functionality**:
   - The basic habit tracking, daily tasks, todo management, and reward system are implemented
   - User data and tasks are persisted in localStorage
   - The UI is responsive and supports dark mode

2. **User Interface**:
   - Dashboard layout with four main sections (Habits, Dailies, Todos, Rewards)
   - Card-based UI components for consistent styling
   - Theme switching between light and dark mode

3. **State Management**:
   - Using React Context API for global state management
   - DashboardContext for user data and tasks
   - ThemeContext for theme preferences

## Next Steps

### Short-term Tasks
1. **Feature Enhancements**:
   - Implement the ability to add new dailies and todos (similar to the existing add habit functionality)
   - Add the ability to delete tasks across all categories
   - Implement editing functionality for existing tasks

2. **UI Improvements**:
   - Enhance visual feedback for task completion
   - Improve mobile responsiveness
   - Add animations for interactions

3. **User Experience**:
   - Implement onboarding for new users
   - Add tooltips and help text
   - Improve accessibility

### Medium-term Goals
1. **Data Management**:
   - Implement data export/import functionality
   - Add data backup options
   - Consider implementing data synchronization

2. **Advanced Features**:
   - Task categories and tags
   - Task prioritization
   - Recurring todos with custom schedules

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Optimize rendering performance
   - Implement memoization for expensive calculations
   - Reduce unnecessary re-renders

### Long-term Vision
1. **Backend Integration**:
   - Develop a backend API for data persistence
   - Implement user authentication
   - Enable cross-device synchronization

2. **Social Features**:
   - Friend connections
   - Challenges and competitions
   - Shared goals and accountability

3. **Advanced Gamification**:
   - Character customization
   - Achievement system
   - Skill trees and specializations

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
1. **State Management**:
   - Currently using React Context API for simplicity
   - Monitoring performance to determine if a more robust solution (Redux, Zustand) is needed

2. **Data Persistence**:
   - Using localStorage for simplicity and quick development
   - Planning for a transition to server-side storage in the future

3. **Component Structure**:
   - Using a modular component approach
   - Evaluating component reusability and potential for abstraction

### UX Considerations
1. **Balance of Gamification**:
   - Ensuring gamification elements enhance rather than distract from productivity
   - Finding the right balance of rewards and challenges

2. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensuring the application is usable by people with different abilities
   - Implementing proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

3. **Performance**:
   - Monitoring and optimizing performance, especially with localStorage
   - Ensuring smooth interactions and transitions

### Open Questions
1. How should we handle data migration when implementing a backend?
2. What additional gamification elements would provide the most motivation without overwhelming users?
3. How can we make the application more engaging for long-term use?
4. What analytics should we track to measure user engagement and success?
