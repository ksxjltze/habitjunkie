# Product Context

## Purpose
HabitJunkie is a personal productivity application designed to help users build and maintain positive habits, manage daily tasks, and track progress through a reward system. The application aims to make habit formation engaging and sustainable by combining habit tracking with task management and a reward system.

## Problems Solved
1. **Habit Formation Difficulty**: Many people struggle to form and maintain positive habits. HabitJunkie provides a structured system to track habits consistently.
2. **Task Management Overwhelm**: Users often feel overwhelmed by their to-do lists. The app separates tasks into daily tasks and general todos for better focus.
3. **Motivation Sustainability**: By incorporating a reward system, the app provides positive reinforcement to maintain user motivation.
4. **Context Switching**: The dashboard approach allows users to see all their productivity areas in one view, reducing the need to switch between different apps.
5. **Gamification of Productivity**: By adding RPG elements like health, experience, and gold, the app makes productivity feel more like a game and less like a chore.

2. **Daily Tasks**:
   - Recurring tasks that reset each day
   - Track completion streaks for consistent performance
   - Completing dailies rewards the user with experience and gold

4. **Reward System**:
   - Users create custom rewards with associated costs
   - Gold earned from completing tasks can be spent on rewards
   - Creates a tangible incentive system for productivity

5. **User Progression**:

   - Gold and gems serve as in-game currency
