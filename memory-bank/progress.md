## Current Status
- **Development Phase**: Early development
- **Stability**: Stable for core features
- **User Testing**: Not yet conducted
- **Documentation**: Initial memory bank created

### Recent Milestones
- Implemented core dashboard layout
- Implemented habit tracking functionality
- Implemented theme switching
- Set up localStorage persistence

### Current Focus
- Initializing memory bank documentation
- Understanding the existing codebase
- Planning next development steps

## Known Issues

### Functional Issues
- No way to add new dailies or todos yet
- No way to delete tasks
- No way to edit existing tasks
- No data validation for user inputs

### Technical Issues
- localStorage has size limitations for data storage
- No error handling for localStorage failures
- No data synchronization across devices
- No offline mode handling

### UI Issues
- Limited mobile optimization
- No loading states or error states
- Limited accessibility features
- No animations or transitions for better UX

### Performance Issues
- Potential performance issues with large datasets in localStorage
- No memoization for expensive calculations
- Context updates may cause unnecessary re-renders

## Next Immediate Steps
1. Implement the ability to add new dailies and todos
2. Add task deletion functionality
3. Implement task editing
4. Enhance visual feedback for actions
5. Improve mobile responsiveness
